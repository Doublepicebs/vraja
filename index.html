    <p>
      Vraja is a conlang that I have been developing discontinuously since 2021. It has undergone many fundamental changes and reforms till its <i>hopefully</i> final version: vraja 7.

    <p>
      Vraja is inspired by Arabic, French and German. It is a <i>priori</i>, meaning it does not use words from our real-life natural languages. In fact, it is spoken in a conworld I am working on called Doa. It is not ready yet, but it is basically an alternate world with different geographical, cultural and technological apects.
